# Playwright Java Automation Framework

This repository contains an automated testing framework built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/java/) and **Java**, using **TestNG** for test execution.  
It demonstrates an end-to-end UI testing setup for web applications, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern for better maintainability.
